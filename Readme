#Brain Tumor Detector

## Description
Brain Tumor Detector is a MATLAB application designed to detect brain tumors in MRI images. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to upload MRI images, apply image processing techniques such as median filtering and edge detection, and finally detect and visualize tumors in the images.

## Features
- GUI interface for easy interaction.
- Upload MRI images for analysis.
- Apply median filtering to preprocess images.
- Perform edge detection to enhance tumor boundaries.
- Detect tumors using image binarization and region properties analysis.
- Visualize detected tumors overlaid on the original MRI images.

## Installation
1. Download the MATLAB code files.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing the code files.
3. Run the `Brain_Tumor_Detector.m` file.

## Usage
1. Launch the application by running `Brain_Tumor_Detector.m` in MATLAB.
2. Click on the "Select Image" button to upload an MRI image for analysis.
3. Use the "Median Filtering" and "Edge Detection" buttons to preprocess the image.
4. Click on the "Tumor Detection" button to detect tumors in the image.
5. View the results in the GUI interface.

## Dependencies
- MATLAB R2016b or later
